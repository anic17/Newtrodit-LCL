## Supported Versions

As Newtrodit is currently in beta, only newer versions will be supported. Only report old vulnerabilities if they still exist on the latest supported version, and not on outdated versions.  

Known bugs:  
 - `^Z` and `^Y` can crash Newtrodit if pressed twice.
 - `^R` crashes Newtrodit on certain occasions, such as having very long lines.
