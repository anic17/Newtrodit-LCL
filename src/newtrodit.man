[1mWhat is Newtrodit?[0m

 Newtrodit is a console-based text editor. As Windows doesn't include a console text editor, 
 Newtrodit is probably your best choice. The editor is designed to be minimalistic and easy to use.
 Even if it's keyboard-based, the keybinds are easy to remember due to the fact that they're
 similar to other applications.
 The main goal is having a noticeable efficiency increase when working.

   The function will search for a file only in the current directory.
   Additionally, you can use wildcards to perform an advanced search.
   Newtrodit will automatically detect if you are using wildcards and it will change the search path accordingly.
   
   The asterisk ([38;2;207;50;68;4m*[0m) can be used to replace any word of any length.
   The question mark ([38;2;207;50;68;4m?[0m) can be used to replace character of always length 1.

   The function will search for the first matches, displaying the date and time in the
   DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss format. File size is shown in bytes.
    
   [37;113;235;37;1mExample[0m
  
    'hello' would match for example a file called 'myhello.txt' and 'hello.txt'
    'hello*' won't match 'myhello.txt', but '*hello*' will.
    'hello.???' will only match files with the name 'hello' and a 3 character extension.

     This wildcards have the same behavior as cmd.exe [1mDIR[0m command ones.

     Known issue: Correct file size displaying is limited to 4 GB due to 32-bit integer limitations.

  
 [37;113;235;37;1mSettings[0m

 Newtrodit can be customizable as you like it by changing some settings.

 Settings file must be located in the same directory as Newtrodit with the name '[1mnewtrodit.config[0m'.
 It's a simple text file with one line per setting, with an INI-like syntax.

 Comments are allowed in the settings file with the '[38;2;207;50;68m;[0m' (semicolon) character.

   [1mBoolean[0m      = Boolean. This setting type stores a boolean value (either 1 or 0).

   In case that a boolean or an integer setting is not a valid value, 0 will be used by default.

 [1mSyntax highlighting[0m

 Newtrodit has some syntax highlighting rules to color the code you're writing and to make it
 easier to read. 

 Syntax highlighting format is similar to the settings format (INI-like), but with some special keywords.
 Each line must start with a keyword followed by an equal sign and the color of the keyword.

 Here's a list of all special keywords:
 [1m $$NEWTRODIT_SYNTAX[0m = This must be the first line of the file to indicate the syntax
                      highlighting format used is the one used by Newtrodit.
                                  
 [1m $$LANGUAGE[0m           = This keyword indicates the language of the code.
 [1m $$COMMENT[0m            = This keyword the comment string.
 [1m $$COMMENT_COLOR[0m      = Comments color.
 [1m $$QUOTE_COLOR[0m        = String color.
 [1m $$DEFAULT_COLOR[0m      = Code that isn't highlighting will be colored in this color.
 [1m $$NUMBER_COLOR[0m       = Every number written will be colored in this color.
 [1m $$SEPARATORS[0m         = Code separator characters. (e.g. ',.()+-/*=~[];{}<> ')
 [1m $$CAPITAL[0m            = Enable capital words syntax highlighting. Use '0' to disable and '1' to enable.
 [1m $$CAPITAL_COLOR[0m      = Color for the highlighted capital words. Requires [1m$$CAPITAL[0m to be set to '1'.
 [1m $$CAPITAL_MIN[0m        = Minimum length for capital words to be highlighted. Requires [1m$$CAPITAL[0m to be set to '1'.

 [1mOld keybinds[0m

 Some keybinds can be changed using the[1m oldkeybinds[0m setting.
 Here's a list of the replaced keybinds:

 [38;2;207;50;68;4m^X[0m --> [38;2;207;50;68;4m^Q[0m (Quit Newtrodit)
 [38;2;207;50;68;4m^K[0m --> [38;2;207;50;68;4m^X[0m (Cut line)
 
 [37;113;235;37;1mDeveloper mode[0m

 Developer mode is a setting made for users who want to use test/debug features on Newtrodit.
 Features of developer mode:
  - Displaying line content ([38;2;207;50;68;4m^D[0m)
  - Displaying old and new console size ([38;2;207;50;68;4mF12[0m)

 To toggle developer mode, press '[38;2;207;50;68;4mS-^D[0m'


 [37;113;235;37;1mConfiguration priority[0m

  The setting that applies last has the highest priority.

  For example, writing 2 lines with the same setting will result in the second line
  being written with the second setting, ignoring the first one.

  Priority order (lowest to highest):
  - Newtrodit default settings
  - Settings file
  - Command line arguments
  - Inside application setting changing
  - Syntax highlighting (for colors scheme)

  Even if a color scheme has been defined in command line arguments, syntax highlighting will override the colored
  keywords.

 [37;113;235;37;1mCrashes[0m

 As all programs, Newtrodit isn't perfect. If you find a bug, please report it on:
  [1m$G/issues[0m

 Most common crash causes are:
  - Not enough memory available
  - Invalid settings file
  - Invalid or too large syntax highlighting scheme
  - Memory allocation error
  - Buffer overflow

 There are also more rare crashes, such as:
  - Memory/stack corruption
  - External program interferences (e.g. external programs that write memory to Newtrodit)
  
  If you find a crash, please report it with all the information on the crash screen.
  

 [37;113;235;37;1mInternal working[0m

 At the moment, Newtrodit has a buffer of $X x $Y. The maximum number of lines is
 $Y, with a buffer increment of $I, while line length depends on the memory available on the system.
 
 This is due to the fact that the buffer is a 2D array of characters. This is one of the main 
 issues that Newtrodit has to deal with and we're working on it.

 It has been coded in C to have maximum performance. At the moment it's only compatible with
 Windows because it uses the Windows API to display the GUI.

 Some more specific internal working behaviors:
  - New lines while reading a file are added when a '[38;2;207;50;68;4m\n[0m' character is found, 
    and not when a custom new line string is found.
