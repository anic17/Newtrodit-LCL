## Motives
&emsp;I once tried to make a clone of the old MS-DOS [EDIT.COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor) in batch. Though during the making of it I realized something. It would have been **really** complicated to use batch, and performance issues were starting to appear.

As I was quite new to C, creating Newtrodit was a challenge to see how good I could make an EDIT.COM clone with more features. The UI got changed plenty of times ‚Äîit even had a blue background back then‚Äî until it became what it is now. I started to love coding Newtrodit, and that's why today I'm continuing to develop Newtrodit to this day.

# Requirements
Newtrodit doesn't need any special requirements for Windows. It can run on Windows versions starting from Windows XP to Windows 11. 

When running Newtrodit on linux you must have any semi-modern terminal emulator, along with a shell that supports VT520, and DECSCUSR sequences. For some features, you also require a POSIX compilent system (which most linux distro's are). 

A list of tested Linux terminals on the three most popular shells can be found below 
| _Tested terminals_ | **BASH 5.1** | **ZSH 5.8** | **FISH 3.1** |
|--------------------|:------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| GNOME Terminal     |       ‚úì      |      ‚úì      |       ‚úì      |
| Terminator         |       ‚úì      |      ‚úì      |       ‚úì      |
| Konsole            |       ‚úì      |      ‚úì      |       ‚úì      |
| Guake              |       ‚úì      |      ‚úì      |       ‚úì      |
| XTERM              |       ‚úì      |      ‚úì      |       ‚úì      |
| RXVT               |       ‚úì      |      ‚úì      |       ‚úì      |
| Alacritty          |       ‚úì      |      ‚úì      |       ‚úì      |

*If your Terminal emulator wasn't listed don't worry*. Any terminal using the following backends are supported: xterm-color, xterm-16color, and xterm-256color. Other backends that fall under the XTerm specifications are: putty, konsole, Eterm, rxvt, gnome. 

Screen mode isn't fully supported and you may find features missing, and if you are using a dumb terminal Newtrodit will fail to run.

If you don't know what any of that stuff means, you don't have to worry about it. Newtrodit should run just fine on your terminal.

# Build
The easiest way to build Newtrodit is to use the `make` files.

Run [`make.bat`](make.bat) if you're Windows, or [`make.sh`](make.sh) if you're using a Linux system.
