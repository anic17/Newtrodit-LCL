# About
Newtrodit is a Windows and Linux supported text editor that was developed with the c language.

## Motives
&emsp;I once tried to make a clone of the old MS-DOS [EDIT.COM]() in batch. Though during the making of it I realized something. It would be **really** complicated to use batch, and performance issues were starting to appear.

As I was quite new to C, creating Newtodit was a challenge to see how good I could make an MS-DOS clone with more features. The UI got changed plenty of times ‚Äîit even had a blue background once‚Äî until it became what it is now. I started to love coding Newtrodit, and that's why today I'm continuing to develop Newtrodit to this day.
